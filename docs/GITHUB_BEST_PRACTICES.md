# GitHub Repository Best Practices

This document outlines comprehensive best practices for creating and maintaining high-quality GitHub repositories. These practices apply to projects of any language or framework and represent modern standards for open-source and professional software development.

## Repository Structure

### Essential Files

- **README.md** - Project introduction, key features, installation instructions, basic usage examples
- **LICENSE** - Legal terms for code usage (MIT, Apache 2.0, GPL, etc.)
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Guidelines for contributors
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Community behavior standards (often using [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/))
- **CHANGELOG.md** - Chronological version history following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- **DEVELOPMENT.md** - Detailed guide for setting up a development environment
- **.gitignore** - Language/framework-specific patterns for files to ignore

### Optional but Recommended

- **SECURITY.md** - Security policy and vulnerability reporting process
- **SUPPORT.md** - How to get help with the project
- **.editorconfig** - Consistent coding styles across editors
- **docs/** - Extended documentation
- **examples/** - Sample usage code
- **ROADMAP.md** - Future development plans

## Version Management

### Semantic Versioning

Follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format:

- **MAJOR** - Incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** - Backward-compatible functionality
- **PATCH** - Backward-compatible bug fixes

### Version Module/File

- Create a dedicated version file/module (`version.lua`, `version.js`, etc.)
- Reference this single source of truth throughout the codebase
- Update this file as part of release process

### Changelog Management

- Follow [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- Group changes by type: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
- Link to issues and pull requests where possible
- Include unreleased section for upcoming changes
- Date releases in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

## GitHub-Specific Configuration

### Templates

#### Issue Templates (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/)

- **bug_report.md** - Template for bug reports with reproduction steps
- **feature_request.md** - Template for new feature suggestions
- **config.yml** - Configure issue form behavior

#### Pull Request Template (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

- Changes made
- Related issues
- Testing done
- Checklist of requirements

### GitHub Actions Workflows (.github/workflows/)

- **ci.yml** - Main CI workflow (lint, style, test)
- **release.yml** - Automate release processes
- **docs.yml** - Documentation building/publishing

### Funding Configuration (.github/FUNDING.yml)

- GitHub Sponsors
- Open Collective
- Patreon
- Ko-fi
- Custom funding URLs

### Discussions Configuration

- Enable GitHub Discussions for Q&A, ideas, announcements
- Configure categories and welcome message
- Direct simple questions to Discussions instead of Issues

## Documentation

### README.md Essential Sections

1. Project name and logo
2. Badges (build status, version, license)
3. Brief description
4. Key features list
5. Installation instructions
6. Basic usage examples
7. Documentation links
8. Contributing information
9. License statement
10. Acknowledgments

### DEVELOPMENT.md

1. Prerequisites (languages, tools, dependencies)
2. Development environment setup
   - Cross-platform instructions (macOS, Linux, Windows)
   - Step-by-step commands
3. Project structure explanation
4. Build process
5. Testing approach
6. Debugging tips
7. Common issues and solutions

### CONTRIBUTING.md

1. Code of conduct reference
2. What contributions are welcomed
3. Development setup link
4. Coding standards/style guidelines
5. Testing requirements
6. Pull request process
7. Review expectations

### Acknowledgements Section

The Acknowledgements section should be included in the README.md to:

1. **Credit Dependencies** - Recognize key libraries, frameworks, and tools your project relies on
2. **Acknowledge Standards** - Reference standards you follow (Semantic Versioning, Contributor Covenant, etc.)
3. **Recognize Contributors** - Highlight significant contributors or inspirations
4. **Attribute Resources** - Credit design assets, documentation templates, or other resources used
5. **Format Recommendations**:
   - Include direct links to acknowledged projects
   - Organize by categories for larger projects
   - Briefly explain how each dependency or standard is used
   - For tools and infrastructure, mention specific benefits they provide

Example Acknowledgements section:
```markdown
## Acknowledgements

- [Framework X](https://example.com) - The core framework this project builds upon
- [Library Y](https://example.com) - Used for handling complex data processing
- [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) - Versioning standard used in this project
- [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) - Code of Conduct standard
- [Tool Z](https://example.com) - Build and optimization tooling
- Project inspired by [Original Concept](https://example.com) by [Original Author]
```

## Quality Assurance

### Linting and Formatting

- Language-appropriate linting tools
- Configuration files in repository root
- Consistent formatting rules
- Pre-commit hooks for automatic checking

### Testing

- Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
- Test coverage expectations
- Instructions for running tests locally
- Continuous integration test configuration

### Pre-commit Hooks

- Install via [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) framework
- Configure in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Include:
  - Linting
  - Formatting
  - Basic tests
  - Commit message validation

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment

### CI Workflow Components

1. **Setup**
   - Multiple platform testing (Linux, macOS, Windows)
   - Multiple version testing (language/framework versions)
   - Caching dependencies for speed

2. **Validation**
   - Linting
   - Code style checking
   - Type checking (if applicable)

3. **Testing**
   - Unit tests
   - Integration tests
   - Coverage reports

4. **Building**
   - Compilation/build steps
   - Artifact creation

### CD Workflow Components (if applicable)

1. **Release creation**
   - Version bump automation
   - Changelog generation
   - GitHub release creation

2. **Publishing**
   - Package registry deployment
   - Docker image publishing
   - Documentation site deployment

## Release Process

### Manual Steps

1. Update version in dedicated version file
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with changes
3. Create pull request for release
4. After merge, tag with version
5. Create GitHub release with changelog excerpt

### Automated Steps

1. Trigger release workflow
2. Automatically:
   - Build artifacts
   - Run tests
   - Create GitHub release
   - Publish packages

## Community Building

1. Set up community discussion forums
2. Create clear path for first-time contributors
3. Tag issues for new contributors
4. Recognize contributions in releases
5. Maintain responsive issue management
6. Provide templates for common interactions

## Security Considerations

1. Define security policy in SECURITY.md
2. Set up security scanning in CI
3. Handle vulnerability reports responsibly
4. Document security considerations for users
5. Regularly update dependencies

## License Selection

Choose an appropriate license based on your goals:

- **MIT** - Simple, permissive
- **Apache 2.0** - Permissive with patent protection
- **GPL** - Copyleft, ensures derivatives remain open source
- **AGPL** - Copyleft that also applies to network services

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

1. Use inclusive language in documentation
2. Provide alt text for images
3. Ensure documentation is screen-reader friendly
4. Consider internationalization/localization
